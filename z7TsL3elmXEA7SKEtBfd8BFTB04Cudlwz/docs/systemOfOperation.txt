New Transaction:
	1) Display all transactions for current month (or any month as desired) with 'copy' button beside each one
	2) Choose Document (defaults to no document for when the transaction has no supporting document)
	3) Choose to either 'copy' a current transaction for modification (any already selected document will replace existing doc), or create a new one (selected doc will be attached)
	4) Edit transaction as required (selection boxes/lists will appear for changing some fields - they will allow new values to be created on the hoof)
	5) Save transaction
	6) New transaction will appear in its context
